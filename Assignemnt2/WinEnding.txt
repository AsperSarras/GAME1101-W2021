After crossing the last door all turned white
Surprised that Zeus decided not to kill me for being
boring, I started thinking how I was supposed to go back
home. When suddenly I hear a noise behaind me.. IT WAS ZEUS!
I Shout:"ZEUS!"
Suddenly I was back at my class I woke up abruptely and shouted
the name of the god that was going to destroy me.
Suddenly the teacher said:"Yeah it was Zeus, the most 
important greece god, good job back there"...
I take my win and run I guess..
