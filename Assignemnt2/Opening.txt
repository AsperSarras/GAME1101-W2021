It was a normal day. I was at school, world history class if I remember correctly.
It all turns dark and suddenly I was in a dark square room.
I felt stronger than ever for no reason at all, but I was afraid.
Where am I, Why am I here, How do I get back?
Just when I was deep in my thinkings I noticed a Letter on the floor.
I should inspect it..
